# Python Practice – Day 2: Loops & Functions


Print numbers divisible by 3, 4, 5  
  - Odd/Even check  
  - FizzBuzz (with variations)  

- **functions.py**  
  - `add(a, b)` → returns the sum of two numbers  
  - `max_of_two(a, b)` → returns the larger number  
  - `is_divisible(a, b)` → checks if `a` is divisible by `b`  
  - `odd_or_even(num)` → prints if a number is odd or even  
  - `multiply(a, b)` → returns the product of two numbers  
  - `min_of_two(a, b)` → returns the smaller number  
  - `is_divisible_by_3_and_5(num)` → checks divisibility by 3 and 5  

## Goal
By the end of Day 2, I wanted to:  
- Write Python loops and use conditions  
- Create and use functions  
- Understand basic logic (`and`, `or`)  
- Practice pushing code to GitHub
